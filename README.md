# Jade King

Passionate techy interested in all things digital and the many ways we can change the world with it.
Created a community based website matching garden owners and growers in just two weeks. Recently graduated from [Makers Academy][3] developer bootcamp as part of the first [Ronin][4] group to complete the course remotely.
Looking for a great place to learn and a great team to learn with. I want to create great user experiences where technology is a help not a hindrance.

## Skills

#### Full Stack Web Development
Have built frontend(link) and backend(link) components through weekly projects at MA. Our biggest project [Lena and Tend][2] is a community website that matches people with spare gardening space to people who want gardening space in London. Built using Rails I contributed to the [frontend][5] creating structure and styling using Bootstrap and [Sass][1], and the [backend][6] creating features such as user profiles and image upload using paperclip and AWS.

#### Test Driven Development
MA focused strongly on TDD and we approached all our projects with a TDD approach, creating [feature][7] and [unit][8] tests. Now that I've started using TDD I can't imagine going back. knowing straight away if you have a bug or if something is being changed is very assuring and can saves hours of future debugging time.

#### Object Oriented Programming
Studied OOP using Java at university and then again at MA using Ruby(link) and Javascript(link). I have good understanding of the Key OOP principles.


#### Behaviour Driven Development


#### Pair Programming
Mastered pair programming via google hangouts. I was part of the first cohort to complete MA remotely so I have learnt to successfully pair program while combating the challenges of working remotely

#### Agile / Scrum
Used to working in an agile environment. As we where the first cohort to do the course remotely there was lot of challenges to overcome and every week we where adjusting how we worked together and how we approached the work. We had daily morning and afternoon stand-ups throughout the course and I am comfortable in leading them.
