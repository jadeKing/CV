# Jade King

Passionate techy interested in all things digital, especially if it's open source and cross platform.
Recently graduated from [Makers Academy][3] developer bootcamp as part of the first [Ronin][4] group to complete the course remotely. Finished the course by creating a website for a community project that matches garden owners and growers in just two weeks. 
Looking for a great place to learn and a great team to learn with. I want to create great user experiences where technology and design is a help not a hindrance.

## Skills

#### Full Stack Web Development
Have built frontend and backend components through weekly projects at MA. Our biggest project [Lena and Tend][2] was built using Rails. I contributed to the [frontend][5] creating structure and styling using Bootstrap, [Sass][1] and HAML and the [backend][6] creating features such as user profiles and image upload using paperclip and AWS. We also did several projects in pure Ruby before learning rails. This helped deepen our understanding of the language.

#### Test Driven Development
MA focused strongly on TDD and we approached all our projects with TDD, creating [feature][7] and [unit][8] tests. I am a strong advocate for TDD but am also capable of working on untested code and writing tests for previously untested code.

#### Pair Programming
Mastered pair programming via google hangouts. Having completed MA remotely I learnt to successfully pair program while also combating the challenges of working remotely.

#### Agile / Scrum
Used to working in an agile environment. Being the first Ronin group there was lot of challenges to overcome and every week we where adjusting how we worked together and how we approached the work. We had daily morning and afternoon stand-ups throughout the course and I am comfortable in leading them.

#### Linux
Have been working on Fedora OS for the last 6 months and am comfortable doing most of my tasks such as testing, file navigation and Git commands from the terminal.
